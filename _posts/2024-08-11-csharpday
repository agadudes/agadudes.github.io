## Working on C-Sharp Recently, and Thinking About Projects

I took a mental break the last two days given that I was working and had little to no energy to give into developing my current project **My Personal Portfolio**, but I did spend a good time thinking about how I would be
building the next few pages, and what are the projects I would like to do after that. Because of course, a portfolio has to contain things I've done. But as of now, the objectives is simply complete that first and on the
side complete the C-Sharp modules in the Microsoft Learning Center. I do want to get certified there, so the roadmap is a clear:

- [ ] Re learn HTML & CSS
- [ ] Learn Javascript
- [ ] Learn C-Sharp
- [ ] Learn to make .NET applications
- [ ] Learn to make web applications with Blazor

Those are the core skills that I need to develop first, and I am thinking about learning CSS & Javascript frameworks as I go, but I feel like the ecosystem within .NET would be sufficient to make cross-platform applications.

The apps I would like to make are:
- [ ] Calculator (just to get a feel of how to build apps)
- [ ] Fasting Timer (I want to build my own with features I actually want that isn't in the app I'm currently using)
- [ ] Cross Platform Budget App (because Google Sheets is not cutting it anymore as more years go by)
- [ ] Gas Use Tracker (that I would integrate into the budgeting app)

A few weeks ago I was really only focused on learning how to code, but I know that it isn't enough until I actually start building something. The portfolio is a start, and I am hoping to branch out more as the days go by.
Tomorrow is another day, and I will try to finish the C-Sharp Module before the week is done, maybe take a week to revise my knowledge, and finally take that certification. With regards to my portfolio, I should have it done
by the end of the week, and then time to think of the next thing to build.
